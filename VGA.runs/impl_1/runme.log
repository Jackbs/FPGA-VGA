WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vs_in_i_2/O, cell vs_in_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT vs_in_i_2 is driving clock pin of 11 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    vs_in_reg {FDRE}
    Vscancounter_reg[9] {FDRE}
    Vscancounter_reg[8] {FDRE}
    Vscancounter_reg[7] {FDRE}
